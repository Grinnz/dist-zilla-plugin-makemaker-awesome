TODO RT#102947: better warning if there is another MakeMaker plugin in use
(we can look for things using the InstallTool role, or inherting from
MakeMaker, and also provide information about what plugin added Makefile.PL.)

------------

14:45 < trs> it's useful if you forgot trailing commas in the dist.ini
14:45 < trs> but it doesn't let you *not* have trailing commas across multiple dist.ini lines.
14:47 < trs> it may turn out to be ETOOMUCHMAGIC, but I wonder about adding commas for lines without a leading delimiter and leaving lines with a delimiter alone.
14:47 < trs> so that if you prepend your dist.ini values with "|" or something, you can fully control the line.
14:47 < trs> but if you don't, MM::Awesome tries to make sure your Makefile.PL isn't a syntax error.
14:48 < trs> even sweeter feature request, while I'm thinking about it: insert Makefile.PL lines from a damn file and be done with any syntax second guessing.
